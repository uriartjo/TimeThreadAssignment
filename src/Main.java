            You will see two empty methods below. Both will, functionally, perform the same actions.
            The first will have you utilize the TimeSystemThread class whereas the second will require you
            to use the TimeSystemRunnable class.

            The method(s) should do the following:
                • Begin a thread outputting current date/time
                • Welcome the user and ask them for their name
                • Take in their name, then output it back.
                     • During this time, the other thread should continuously be outputting the date/time
                       in five second intervals as defined within the method.
